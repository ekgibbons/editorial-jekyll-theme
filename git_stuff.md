This is a brief collection of online tutorials of how to set up git repositories and best practices for managing them.  I have sent various forms of this information out a few times via email, and it seems like it will be easiest if I just manage the tutorials here instead.

### Basics

The first thing you will need to do is sign up for a GitHub account.  There are a few cloud-based repository services out there, but GitHub seems to be the reference standard.  A free account works, but they limit you on the number of private repositories when you go that route.  If you are a student, you can find sign up for the education pack, which gives you a free premium account so long as you are a student.  You can sign up for the [education discounts here.](http://education.github.com)

Now you have your free account, you should start setting up the repositories.  GitHub has some great tutorials on doing this.

[Adding a file to a repository using the command line.](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/)

And that is pretty much what git is.

### Branching and Previous Commits

One of the strengths of version control is keeping your work tidy and being able to reference prior work easily.  (I guess that should be explanatory based on the name...)   Anyway, branches are a good way to do this.
